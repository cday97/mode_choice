After a deep understanding is acheived, the next goal will be to align BEAMs current mode choice process with ActivitySims. By updating BEAMs mode choice process, the outputs generated by BEAM will be more meaningful and in line with the inputs given by ActivitySim. In Beam, two mode choice processes exist: the multinomial logit choice model and the latent class choice model. First the theory behind the two choice models as well as utility theory is explained. Then, the specifics of how the multinomial mode choice model and the latent class mode choice model work in BEAMs code is explained. Afterwards, the specifics of how ActivitySims mode choice is organized is explained. A comparison will be given between the mode choice parameters given by an analysis done in SLC in ActivtySim and BEAMs default values. Finally, a proposal to align BEAMs mode choice model with ActivitySims is given. More specifically, the idea is to implement mode choice decisions based on purpose within BEAM. 1 Introduction The most prominent behavior in BEAM is mode choice. Since BEAM is an adaptive microsimulation modeling tool, the mode choice in BEAM is also adaptive. Yes, mode choice can be specified in the plans file, but after the 0 iteration, the adaptive process takes place. The following modes are considered as options in BEAM: walk car bike ride_hail ride_hail_pooled walk_transit drive_transit bike_transit ride_hail_transit The mode options are displayed in the correct format for usage in BEAM. Also, walk is the fallback modal option if for some reason the planned mode becomes impossible within the framework. There are two mode choice models set up within BEAM to adaptively select modes for each user based on default parameters. The first one is the multinomial logit mode choice model. The second one is the latent class mode choice model. These two mode choice models will be explained thoroughly in Chapter 3. Following the explanation of the mode choice models in BEAM, Chapter 4 dives into the mode choice model in ActivitySim, and proposes why implementing a purpose based mode choice model in BEAM could prove beneficial. It also shows a comparison between the mode choice parameters from ActivitySim and BEAM to further prove why it is beneficial. Additional information about BEAMs mode choice can be found in the user guide at https://beam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/behaviors.html#mode-choice. Information about ActivitySims mode choice can be found the Calibration and Validation of the model at [http://analytics.mtc.ca.gov/foswiki/pub/Main/Documents/2012_05_18_RELEASE_DRAFT_Calibration_and_Validation.pdf].
