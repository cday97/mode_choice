  The purpose of this exploration is to understand as much as possible about the current mode choice processes in BEAM. More specifically, an analysis of the multinomial mode choice model is done first, followed by an analysis of the latent class mode choice model. Within each analysis, the theory behind both models as well as how they are specifically implemented in the BEAM code are both explained. 
  
  In addition, an analysis of the mode choice model in ActivitySim is conducted. Understanding the mode choice model in ActivitySim is essential as many of our inputs to BEAM come from the ActivitySim model. Therefore, as a way to better align the two models, the idea of implementing a purpose based mode choice model within BEAM is brought up.

# Introduction {#intro}

The most prominent behavior in BEAM is mode choice. Since BEAM is an adaptive microsimulation modeling tool, the mode choice in BEAM is also adaptive. Yes, mode choice can be specified in the plans file, but after the 0 iteration, the adaptive process takes place.

The following modes are considered as options in BEAM:

  - walk
  - car
  - bike
  - ride_hail
  - ride_hail_pooled
  - walk_transit
  - drive_transit
  - bike_transit
  - ride_hail_transit
  
The mode options are displayed in the correct format for usage in BEAM. Also,  walk is the fallback modal option if for some reason the planned mode becomes impossible within the framework. 

There are two mode choice models set up within BEAM to adaptively select modes for each user based on default parameters. The first one is the multinomial logit mode choice model. The second one is the latent class mode choice model. These two mode choice models will be explained thoroughly in the following chapters:

  - **Multinomial Logit Mode Choice** (\@ref(chap3))
  - **Latent Class Mode Choice** (\@ref(chap4))
  
Following the explanation of the mode choice models in BEAM, the chapter **Purpose Based Mode Choice** (\@ref(chap5)) dives into the mode choice model in ActivitySim, and proposes why implementing a purpose based mode choice model in BEAM could prove beneficial. 

Additional information about BEAM's mode choice can be found in the user guide at [https://beam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/behaviors.html#mode-choice](https://beam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/behaviors.html#mode-choice).
